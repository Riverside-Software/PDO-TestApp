This sample shows how to sort an UltraTree control using its RefreshSort() method and the System.Collections.IComparer interface.

The TreeSortComparer class implements the System.Collections.IComparer interface. This class is then assigned to the UltraTree property SortComparer: ultraTree1:OVERRIDE:SortComparer = TreeLevelSortComparer.
The TreeSortComparer class is used by the UltraTree when its RefreshSort() method is called.
