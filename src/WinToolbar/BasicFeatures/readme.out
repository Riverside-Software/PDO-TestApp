This sample shows all the basic properties for UltraToolbars.

The code that setups the toolbars is in InitializeToolbarsManager1 and InitializeToolbarsManager2.
All the functionality of the form is in the control events, a ListBox control on the bottom of the form logs all the UltraToolbar fired events.
