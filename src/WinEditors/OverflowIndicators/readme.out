This sample shows how to add or remove the OverflowIndicators to WinEditor controls.
The editor will display an overflow indicator when the display text is not completely visible. When the user mouses over the overflow indicator it displays a tooltip which shows all of the display text.

The relevant code of this sample is in the Form1_Load event, and chkUseOverflowIndicators_CheckedChanged method, which set/unset the ShowOverflowIndicator attribute.
