This sample shows the SpinWrap Property works for the UltraWinEditors.

The SpinWrap property returns or sets a value indicating whether the control's spin button should wrap its value. If true, the spin button will wrap the value incremented/decremented based on its Min/Max value.

The SpinWrap for the UltraWinEditors is set in the CheckEditor_CheckedChanged event.
