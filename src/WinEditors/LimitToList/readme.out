This sample shows how the UltraComboEditor LimitToList property works.

The LimitToList property specifies whether the UltraComboEditor will retain focus upon validation whenever the entered value is not a value in the control's ValueList.
The ItemNotInList event is fired before the Validating event of the UltraComboEditor whenever the text value entered into the editor portion of the control is not a value in the control’s ValueList.

In order to try the sample, add values that are not in the list in the UltraComboEditor, and tab out to the control.
