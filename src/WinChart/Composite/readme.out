This sample demonstrates binding of the chart layers of a composite chart to different external data sources.

Because each chart layer can be tied to one or more unique series of data, it is quite simple to use multiple data sources to generate the data for different chart layers.  

The series data is retrieved using two instances of System.Data.DataTable populated with data from two queries in two separate DataServices that retrieve data from the Sports2000 Database.
