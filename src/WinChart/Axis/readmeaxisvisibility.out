This sample shows how to control the visibility of the axis of the chart.  The UltraWinChart allows this through a Visible property on each available axis (X, X2, Y, Y2).

This sampe allows you to manipulate the visibility of the X and Y axis of the chart.  Simply check the X Axis VIsible or YAxis Visible checkbox to show or hide the indicated axis from the chart.
