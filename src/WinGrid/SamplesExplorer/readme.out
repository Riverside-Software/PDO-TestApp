I - Events used throughout the samples. 
------------------------------------------------
a. Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraGrid:InitializeLayout
  - Hides columns and manipulates formats.
  - Deals with grid appearance properties like alpha blending and colors. 

b. Progress.Windows.Form:Load
  - set control properties. 
  - populates combos.   
  - sets the grid's datasource.
        
UltraDropDown
-------------
Demonstrates how the UltraDropDown control can be used to provide the end user 
with multi-column dropdown lists. 

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid and UltraDropDown control. The two
controls are bound to their data sources at runtime.  

The UltraGrid is bound to a CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class 
(Service Adapter) that provides customer, order and orderline data from a 
Data Access object connected to the Sports2000 database. 

The UltraDropDown Grid is bound to another ABL DataService that provides
item data from Sports2000 and is used as a dropdown in the Itemnum column of the 
UltraGrid. 

The UltraDropDown's ValueMember property specifies the column in the 
UltraDropDown control that will supply the value to the UltraGrid cell, 
analogous to a ValueListItem's or a SmartDataField's DataValue. 

The UltraDropDown's DisplayMember property specifies the column in the 
UltraDropDown control that will supply the display text to the UltraGrid cell, 
analogous to a ValueListItem's DisplayText or a SmartDataField's DisplayField. 

The UltraDropDown control appears to be a ValueList from the grid's 
perspective and the "ItemNum" column's ValueList property is set to the 
UltraDropDown control to make it appear as a dropdown list in the grid. 

(See the ConfigureUltraDropDown() method for details.)

ColumnStyles         
------------
This sample illustrates the various ColumnStyles supported in the DataGrid. It 
also shows a multi column drop down that is not a supported ColumnStyle. 

The "Select column styles to show" combo box has a list of all the styles and 
selecting one of the styles will make the Grid go to that column. The 
"Description" field shows a short description of the style (some of the styles
do not have any description). The "Select when buttons display" lists options on
how and when columns that have buttons should visualize the buttons. Selecting 
an option will apply the choice to all columns and demonstrate the chosen 
behavior. The AutoFit columns option is currently not implemented due to a 
problem. (TODO fix error and remove this)     

The sample is highly dynamic and reads the supported ColumnStyles from the 
class. The styles are stored in a temp-table that are used to create a DataTable 
as well as populate the combo with the Styles. The GridData columns are created 
from this temp-table in the initializeLayout event of the DataGrid.  

The data are completely random and mostly genererated using the ABL's 
random function. The DropDopwn and DropDown list combo boxes in the DataGrid 
are populated with data from sports2000 through an ABL DataService. They are 
not populated with data binding, but are using a dedicated Infragistic API in 
the service. The returned ValueList is added to GridData:Layout:ValueLists from 
where the controls retrieve the data on the initialization event. 

The DropDownValidate column is just populated with numbers and added to the  
GridData:Layout:ValueLists collection, which then is used to poulate the combo 
on the initialization event.   

The last column in the Grid is the multi drop downlist, which is not one of 
the supported ColumnStyles. This sample is using a Progress Binding Source that 
provides a state temp-table from the sports2000 state table. It is bound to a 
Win.UltraWinGrid.UltraDropDownDropDownCombo that is added to the Form at design 
time. 

ValueLists
------------
This sample illustrates how to use ValueLists to provide the end user with 
dropdown lists.  

The sample starts up showing a grid with data. Checking the "show value 
lists" check box will add a Value List to the  "Spacelines", "ArrivalPort", 
"Departure Port" and "Status" fields. The SpaceLines Value List has an image 
in addition to the text. Note that the calendar popup appears automatically 
for a column that is mapped to a date field.    

The data is from an ABL DataSource with random generated data. The DataGrid is 
databound to the ProDataset while the 3 valuelists are populated from the other 
temp-tables in the grid using a dedicated Infragistic API in the service. The 
returned ValueList is added to GridData:Layout:ValueLists from where the 
controls retrieve the data when the ValueLists are enabled. 
 
The sample also has a check box that enables Alpha Blending. 
         
UIElements
----------
This sample illustrates and shows details about all the UI Elements of the 
UltraGrid when you click on them. 

The form uses two Splitters and two Panels to split the area in three virtual
panels. The grid is not on a panel and is manually resized in PositionGrid, 
which is called from the Splitter's Move event and the form's Resize and Load
event.    

At runtime the ListView on bottom left is populated with properties from the 
UI element with focus while the multiline TextBox on bottom right shows the 
element ancestry by walking through the parent attribute of the elements with
the current UI element at top.
   
The Grid's MouseEntryElement event calls DisplayUIElementProperties() to 
refresh the ListView with properties, DisplayUIElementAncestors() to show the  
ancestry in the TextBox and HighlightUIElement() which marks the element
red with white foreground.  

The Grid's MouseLeaveElement event calls HighlightUIElement() to reset the 
UI element color.

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
customer, order and orderline data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.   



Sorting
-------
This sample demonstrates the automatic sorting capabilities of the UltraGrid. 
All columns on all levels can be sorted ascending and descending. The sort
on a child level row is applied to all child rows of all parents.  

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.
       
RowProperties
-------------
This sample demonstrates the various properties that can be set on the row, 
including AutoPreview, variable row height, alternating colors, and more.

The set of controls on the left on the form are all defined with events that 
modifies a row attribute that corresponds to the control's label dynamically at 
runtime. 

This sample also shows how to walk through a grid's bands and columns at runtime
to check and change column attributes. The FormatCurrencyColumns is called from 
the grid's InitializeLayout event to set the Format of all decimal column's. 

The form's load event combo sets the max and min value of the trackbars
(sliders) and calls PopulateRowSizingCombo() and 
PopulateRowConnectorStyleCombo() to populate the two comvo boxes. 

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
customer, order and orderline data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.   

PerformAction
-------------  
This sample demonstrates the use of the PerformAction method and the KeyMappings
collection, which together allow all actions of a grid to be manipulated at 
runtime from events or by the user from keys. The keys can also be added to the
grid's keymapping collection at runtime. 

The "PerformAction" tab allows one to test the use of the various actions that
can be applied to the grid. The "CurrentState" ListBox shows the state of the 
grid at any time or more specifically, every 100 millisecond as specified by a 
timer. The "UltraAction" combo allows one to select an action from the list of 
actions that can be applied to the grid. The two check boxes can be checked to 
test the action with shift and/or cntrl.

Clicking the "Perform Action" button will call the UltraGrid's PerformAction() 
with the selected action as the first parameter while the check boxes Checked
attribute is passed to the shiftkey and controlkey parameters. The Click event
shows an error message if PerformAction returns false in the case the action
could not be performed in the current state. 

The "KeyMappings" tab allows one to test the setting of key mappings for the 
grid. The "Keys" allows one to select a key from the list of the forms supported
keys. The "Action to Map" allows one to select one of the grid's supported 
actions (similar to the "UltraAction" on the first tab). There are also two 
multi select list boxes that has state values that can be selected to specify 
what the key mapping should have as required state and disallowed state.

Clicking the "Add Key Mapping" button will add a new GridKeyActionMappingkey 
instance to the grid's KeyActionMappings collection. The constructor of 
the Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.GridKeyActionMappingkey parameters keyCode,
actionCode, stateDisallowed and stateRequired are set from the controls in the 
form. (The constructor also has a disallowed and a required parameter for 
special keys ((Alt, Ctrl, Shift), which are set to ? and not used.) 

--
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

The sample uses Progress.Util.EnumHelper to check and set enumerated members
at runtime. The And() is used in PopulateCurrentStateValaues() to loop through 
the supported GridState values and compare it to the CurrentValue to add the 
matching values to the "CurrentValue" Listbox. The Or() is used in 
GetDisallowedStateForKeyMapping and GetRequiredStateForKeyMapping to return 
multiple states from the multi ListBoxes and pass to the GridKeyActionMappingkey
 constuctor's disallow and required state parameters.
 
AlphaBlending
-------------
Ths sample demonstrates the alpha blending properties of the controls. Alpha 
Blending is a function of the Windows Operating System (Win98/Win2000). Some 
display elements overlay others and this allows the UltraGrid to control the 
transparency of cells, rows, headers and other display elements. 

The form has two TrackBar components that are defined with Scroll events that 
calls an UpdateDisplay() method that sets the AlphaLevel property of the
grid's Row-, Header- and CellAppearance. The upper TrackBar controls the Header
and Row, while the lower controls the Cell. 

--
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

SummaryRows
-----------
This sample demonstrates how to configure the UltraGrid as well as let the user
control how to display total, average, max, min and/or count for columns in 
dedicated summary rows.  

Right-click on a column to add it to its Band's Summaries collection, or modify 
its SummarySettings if it has already been added. Click the 
'Summary Row Settings' button to display the Summary Row Settings dialog.

The orderline Qty and Extended price is set up to show the sum programatically 
in the form's Load event (frmRowSummaries_Load). 

Pressing the "Summary Row Settings" will open a dialog (frmSummaryRowSettings) 
that displays and edits the following summary settings. 

1. AllowRowSummaries. 
Use the "select band" combo to select whether to apply the setting to all or 
one of the bands and select one of the six "AllowRowSummaries" options. 

2. Appearance on the summary footer.   
Select one of the three summary footer areas in the "Appearances" radio-set and
manipulate properties in the PropertyGrid on the right side. 

3. BorderStyle.
Select the style to apply to the ccurrent selected summary footer.   

4. SummaryFooterCaptionVisible
Click on the tri-state check-box to set the visibility of the summary footer
caption to true, false or indeterminate (?).  

---
The form contains a System.Windows.Forms.PropertyGrid, which is activated in 
event procedures by setting the PropertyGrid's SelectedObject to the applicable
object.   

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

CustomDrawing (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
-------------------------------
This sample demonstrates the custom drawing capabilites of the grid.

Move your cursor over the grid's background to see the custom drawing of the 
background. The UltraGrid allows you to custom draw everything it draws. The 
form implements Infragistics.Win.IUIElementDrawFilter in order to be added as  
the grid's DrawFilter. The GetPhasesToFilter() is set to filter the 
BeforeDrawForeGround event. The DrawFilter() is customized to draw an image at 
the current cursor position.

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
EmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
employee data from a Data Access object connected to the Sports2000 database.

RowFiltering
------------
This sample demonstrates the row filtering feature, which adds a filter drop 
down on the column header. This includes a custom option that opens a dialog 
where the user can add multiple filter criteria on the column.   

The form starts up with filter on Country and State. Each column header have a 
filter drop down on the column. 

The "Row Filter Action" combo-box switches between hiding, disabling or just
changing appearance of the filtered rows.

The 4 buttons all opens an Appearance Attribute dialog (frmAppearencePicker.cls)
that displays and edits appearance settings of the filtered or unfiltered rows 
or columns.

---
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

CardView
--------
This sample demonstrates the features of CardView, which is a setting that 
makes the grid layout its column in a viewer-like fashion. 

The form starts up with the CardView attribute set to true on the Customer band.
It has 3 tabs that all can be used to test different CardView looks and 
behavior. 

The "Activate CardView on Band" combo-box on the "Card Settings" tab is defined 
to set CardView to true on any of the three bands and turn it off on the others.

The 16 entries in the ListView on the "Looks" tab represents some sample 
appearances that is applied to the CardView upon selection. 
 
The other tabs on the "Card Settings" tab allows properties to be changed 
individually throug PropertyGrids attached to the current CardView and the 
Override object that holds the Grid's Appearance object. 

The "Grid Settings" tab has a combo box that shows and changes the ViewStyle 
of the grid and check boxes to turn on caption and AlphaBlending. It also has a
PropertyGrid that displays and edits all grid properties. 

The "Notes" tab explains how the user can control size and gruping with the 
mouse and also explains which properties that can be used to control max 
number of rows an columns.    
----

The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
customer, order and orderline data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

The "Country" column's drop down value list with flag images is hard coded in 
PopulateFlagsValueList() with images from an ImageList.   

The ApplyCurrentLook() method has the hard coded 16 CardView sample cases.

The SetupForNewBand() method sets up the selected band as a CardView.
 
Appearances
-----------
This sample demonstrates the UltraWinGrid's extensive appearance hierarchy. 

Double Click on an appearance node in the treeview or right click an select
a menu item from the drop down menu to open the PropertyGrid and adjust the 
appearance of the corresponding grid control.

The "Support Themes" check box is defined to set the grid's SupportThemes. 
Setting this to false will turn off the appearance properties that are set by the
Window's Theme and use the values from the grid.
 
--
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to an 
EmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
employee data from a Data Access object that reads data from an XML file.

The treeview layout is hard coded in PopulateTree(). The Double Click event
method (tvwAppearances_DoubleClick) starts a new frmAppearancePicker() to edit 
the control that corresponds to the selected node. 

The Grid's MouseDown event method (gridAppearances_MouseDown) checks for a 
Right-mouse click and sets the popup menus sensitivity and context variables 
to use in the menu events.
 
The menu item events calls LoadAppearancePicker that starts a new 
frmAppearancePicker() to edit the control that corresponds to the menu item.
 
ViewStyle
--------- 
This sample demontrates the ViewStyle and ViewStyleBand properties, which
controls the overall look and feel of the grid. 
 
The form has radio sets that are defined to set the grid's ViewStyle to
MultiBand or SingleBand and the grid's ViewStyleBand to Horizontal, 
Vertical or OutlookGroupBy. One can also set one of the band's CardView to 
true and set the grid to merge cells, use Borders, Spacing, Background,
AlphaBlending and set the BackColor. There is also an option to use compact
group by box when the ViewStyleBand is OutlookGroupBy.

--
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to an 
EmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
employee data from a Data Access object connected to the Sports2000 database.

The InitializeBandProperties has code to hide most of the columns when 
the ViewStyle is MultiBand and the ViewStyleBand is horizontal. 

ColumnChooser
-------------
This sample demonstrates several variatons of the Column Chooser Functionality, 
which allows the user to remove and add columns to the grid.

The form has two pages with two grids that both illustrates variations of 
the ColumnChooser. The first page shows the built in Column Chooser and has 
controls that accepts changes to Column Chooser as well as Column Chooser 
related settings for the columns. The second page shows how to customize the 
column chooser and the button starts a CustomColumnChooser.cls, which is part 
of the samples source code. 

The CustomColumnChooser dialog has the ColumnChooser as well, but with addtional
 controls to add new and delete columns. The new button starts a 
NewColumnDialog.cls, which has a Formula control that allows one to define 
fields that shows data based on formulas of the other columns.  

---
The form is designed with two empty UltraGrids that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
cusdtomer, order and orderline from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

FixedHeaders
-------------
This sample demonstrates the fixed headers feature, which allows selected 
columns as specified by code or the user, to remain fixed while scrolling 
horizontally. 
 
The form starts up with some columns fixed in each band.

The "Fixed Headers On" check-box is set up to turn the feature on or off using 
the grid's DisplayLayout:UseFixedHeaders. 

The "Fixed Header Indicator" combo shows the valid options and applies changes 
to the Override:FixedHeaderIndicator, which contols how the fixed columns are 
visualized and manipulated by the user. 

The "Fixed Cell Separator Color" is a color picker that applies a color to the 
Override:FixedCellSeparatorColor. 

The buttons opens the frmAppearancePicker with a PropertyGrid to adjust the 
appearance of the fixed header (Override:FixedHeaderAppearance) or fixed cell
(Override:FixedCellAppearance).

---
The form is designed with two empty UltraGrids that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
customer, order and orderline from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

The grid's InitializeLayout event sets CustNum, OrderNum, LineNum and ItemNum 
columns' Header:Fixed to true.

Virtual Rows (frmUltraDataSource1.cls)
--------------------------------------
This sample demonstrates the UltraDataSource component in virtual mode and shows
an example that scrolls (virtually) through 1 million rows.  

It demonstrates the concept with minimal amount of code and dynamically 
generated data. This exact approach would not be used in a real application, 
but it illustrates low level grid functionality that could be useful to resolve 
perfomance issues or other customizations.  

The grid's LoadStyle is set to LoadOnDemand in the form's load 
event.
		
The data source's CellDataRequested event is used to load data, which in this
case are generated from the Row:Index and Column:Index. The cell's CacheData 
is set to false in the event to prevent the grid from caching the data. 

Virtual Rows (frmUltraDataSource2.cls)
--------------------------------------
This sample also demonstrates the UltraDataSource component in virtual mode and 
shows. This exact approach would rarely be used in a real application, but it 
illustrates low level grid functionality that could be useful to resolve 
perfomance issues or other customizations. 

This sample highlights that the built in sorting would not work when data is 
loaded in the CellDataRequested event and overrides the AfterSortChange event to
control the sorting. It also overrides the BeforeRowFilterDropDownPopulate event
to control the filter popup menu. 

Note that allthough the sorting works, the repositioning is relative to the 
grid's index number. I.e. if you are on record 1000 and perform a resort, the 
grid will still be on row 1000, but in relation to the new sort expression.    

-----
The data of the grid is stored in a Temp-table and a "preselect" query is used 
to apply sorting and to ensure that the grid's index can be used as a key to 
get the corresponding data from the temp-table in the CellDataRequested event.   

Filter Row
----------
This sample demonstrates the Fixed FilterRow feature, which will add a row 
dedicated to filter criteria above the data rows.   

The form has two pages above the grid. The first page allows you to manipulate 
the various attributes related to the FilterRow feature, with Grid wide 
settings on the left. The right side has combo-box that allow you to select a 
column and apply similar attributes on column level. The second page allows you
to manipulate the appearance of various visual parts affected by the FilterRow 
feature. There is also a section that sets properties for the separator between
the grid and the FilterRow 
  
The filter row user interface is enabled by setting the FilterUIType to 
FilterRow. This is done in the gird's InitializeLayout event procedure, which
also sets up several other related properties and fills the various property 
combo boxes with data. 

---
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
CustOrderDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
customer, order and orderline from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

Document Export
---------------
This sample demonstrates document exporting capabilities of the UltraGrid, 
including the ability to preview the output.

The form allows you to select the print format (pdf or xps) and decide whether 
and how to print page numbers. You can also check whether to add various text 
sections. There is an “open the file after export” option that allows you to 
see the report in Adobe reader (pdf) or IE (xps).

The second band has three columns that are defined to Allow Summaries, which
also will be exported if specified.   

---
The form utilizes several non-visual classes for the export:
The Infragistics.Win.UltraWinGrid.DocumentExport.UltraGridDocumentExporter is
used to export the report to a file.

The Infragistics.Win.Printing.UltraPrintPreviewDialog is used to Preview the
grid report. 

The Infragistics.Win.Printing.UltraPrintDocument does the actual printing and 
its PrintPage event is used to control the printing.   

--
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to a 
DeptEmployeeDataService, which is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
department, employee and family data from a Data Access object connected to the 
Sports2000 database.

Excel Export
------------ 
This sample demonstrates export of images and formulas to Excel. 
   	
The Form has a Folder with a grid on each page. The first page has a grid with 
various formulas added as custom Summary Rows. The second page shows employee
records with an images. The Form has an Export to Excel button that exports the 
current page to demonstate export of formulas and images to excel.  

--
The UltraGrid on the first page is designed with 3 fields added manually in the 
UltraGrid designer. A corresponding temp-table is added as data source at 
runtime. 
 
The UltraGrid on the second page is designed using an XML schema 
(DataServices/EmployeeService.xsd) and is bound to an EmployeeService at 
runtime.  The EmployeeService is an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides 
employee data from a Data Access object that reads the data from an XML file. 

The sample uses an UltraGridExcelExport component and the formula and image are 
managed in various events of this component.   

The formulas are defined in the grid designer, which uses the UltraCalcManager
to define formulas. 

RowLayout
---------
This sample demonstrates the Row Layout functionality, which gives complete 
control of the grid layoyut and can be saved and loaded from external files.

The sample has a TabControl with 5 pages. The 4 first pages shows Employee
grids of two types; a standard view RowLayout and a CardView RowLayout, which 
both are shown in two exact similar versions. The first grid of each type is 
built at design time with the UltraGrid designer while the second of each grid
has a row layout that is created with code at runtime. The sample also shows 
how to make a BLOB with image be treated as such in the grid. ()  

The last page shows a regular view that is using a row layout loaded from an 
external file. This page has controls that allows you to select a band and 
turn UseRowLayout off and on and manipulate and test various row layout 
properties, many of which controls how the grid itself can be manipulated at 
runtime. This abilty to save and load row layouts allows many grids' to use the 
same layout and/or have many layouts for the same grid. It can be used to allow 
the user to save his own layout, whihc almost is a requirement for the user to 
truly benefit from the various abilites to control the layout at runtime.   
 
-----
The UltraGrids on page 1 and 3 are designed using an XML schema 
(DataServices/EmployeeService.xsd). All the 4 Employee grids are bound to the 
same EmployeeService at runtime. The EmployeeService is an ABL class 
(Service Adapter) that provides employee data from a Data Access object that 
reads the data from an XML file. 

The UltraGrid on page 5 is bound at runtime to a CustOrderDataService, which is 
an ABL class (Service Adapter) that provides customer, order and orderline from 
a Data Access object connected to the Sports2000 database.

The stored row layout was built in the UltraGrid designer, but was stored using 
the layout's own save method: ultragrid1:displaylayout:Save( "RowLayout2.lyt" ).  
The load method is then used in the grid's initializeLayout event handler. 

Note that the while the design time and runtime UltraGrid's look exactly similar
there might still be row layout properties that are different.  

Conditional Formatting
----------------------
This sample demonstrates how to change the appearance of columns based on data 
using ConditionValueAppearances. 

Note that most of the effects in this sample could be achieved more easily and 
with less code by using the grid's InitializeRow event. However, the conditional
formatting feature has several advantages over the InitializeRow event. First, 
conditional formatting can be set up at Design-time. Also, conditional 
formatting can be saved along with the grid's DisplayLayout, and you can 
display the conditional formatting designer dialog to the users so they can 
create custom formatting (which will save along with the DisplayLayout). 
 
Try changing the values in the grid cells or sort the columns. 
The formatting will update appropriately.

----
The UltraGrid is bound to ProBindingSource which has manual definitions and 
is bound to a temp-table at run time. (The definitions in the bindingsource
are not required). The data, numbers from -10 to 10 in each column are  
generated in CreateData.

Empty Rows
-----------
This sample demonstrates the Empty Rows Functionality, which controls how to 
visualize the area in the grid where there is no data. 

The form has controls that allows you to test various empty row related 
attributes. The "Show Empty Rows" check box turns the grid's  
EmptyRowSettings:ShowEmptyRows off and on. The "Style" combo box allows you to 
select and apply styles for the grid's EmptyRowSettings:ShowEmptyRows attribute.
The four buttons allows you to manipulate appearance attributes of the 
empty area, empty row, empty cell and the empty area row selector.

-------
The form is designed with an empty UltraGrid that is bound at runtime to an 
ABL SampleData class that provides a dataset with generated data.   

Fixed Rows
----------
This sample demonstrates the Fixed Rows Functionality, which specifies a number 
of visible rows on the top of the grid that are always visible, even when the 
user scrolls the other rows in the grid. It can be used to display column
